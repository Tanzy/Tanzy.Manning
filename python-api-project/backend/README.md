# Backend API Documentation

## Overview
This project is a Flask-based API that accepts JSON file uploads and processes the data. It is designed to work in conjunction with a frontend application that allows users to upload JSON files.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-api-project/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   Then install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   Start the Flask server:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

To upload a JSON file, send a POST request to the `/upload` endpoint with the file included in the request. The frontend application provides a user-friendly interface for this.

## Endpoints

- **POST /upload**
  - Accepts a JSON file upload.
  - Processes the uploaded data and returns a response.
